# learningGithub
Just a repository i set up to properly understand github
I happen to be learning a lot about github
the idea this time is to learn about branching
so i quickly created a new branch and now I am editing it
hey...so what do u think?
Had to create several pull requests to get the hang of it!
Currently working towards at 8/10 grade in my git knowledge and application
I can achieve it right? Yes I can.
